Jean Anemo Mondstadt
The Knights of Favonius are the protectors of Monstadt, the swords and shields of the city. In
addition to keeping the city and the surrounding travel routes safe from the threat of wild monsters,
the Knights' most important responsibility is maintaining order among Monstadt's inhabitants.
Mondstadt is the City of Freedom, but unchecked freedom without any kind of rules only invites
chaos and anxiety. Jean's understanding of this is the reason she remains diligent at all times,
holding herself to impeccable standards. However, she often finds that she exhausts her monthly
quota of coffee within the first few days of the month as a result.
