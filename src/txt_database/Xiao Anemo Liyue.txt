Xiao Anemo Liyue
Xiao may have the appearance of a young man, but his true age is something over two thousand
years. Fortunately, people do not tend to underestimate him on the basis of his appearance—one
only needs to spend a short time with Xiao to clarify that he is not someone to be trifled with. Xiao is
a man of few words. He is highly dangerous, and has the most piercing gaze you've ever seen. He
enjoys a formidable reputation and high level of seniority among the adepti, but is relatively unknown
in the mortal realm. This is inevitable. Xiao is not one of those popular deities to whom people pray
for wealth and protection, nor is he a mystical sage of Jueyuejian to whom pilgrims flock in search of
divine wisdom. No; if any mortal is unfortunate enough to witness Xiao unleash his true power, it is
certain to be under the most dire of circumstances—and they will be extremely lucky if they survive
the ordeal. This is not because Xiao seeks to harm people. Rather, since Xiao is accustomed to
waging war against dark forces powerful enough to devour Liyue in its entirety, any bystanders who
witness him in the heat of battle are likely to end up as victims of circumstance. To be clear, this
simply means that collateral damage is hard to avoid—not that Xiao goes around silencing
witnesses
