Venti Anemo Mondstadt
An unknown bard that came from nowhere. He sometimes sings outdated songs, other times he
hums new ones that none have ever heard of. He likes apples and lively atmospheres, but hates
cheese and anything that is slimy. When channeling Anemo, it appears in the form of out-stretched
feathers, because he likes things that look light.
