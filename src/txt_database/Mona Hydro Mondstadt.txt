Mona Hydro Mondstadt
Teyvat is a place where people of all sorts go about their business. Merchants move product,
knights patrol, and farmers till the land. But if one were to ask Mona - the enigmatic and prideful
astrologist - what she busies herself with, she will reply by saying that she is servicing a debt
known as "life." She will, however, vigorously deny being "poor," giving the following explanation:
"Beautiful veneers may obscure simple truths. Exquisite food may mask its nutritional value. One
lives simply, all the better to expose this world's truths." A frugal lifestyle, therefore, is a form of
training to access the truth... Or so Mona will insist. Teyvat is a place where people of all sorts go
about their business, and even an enigmatic astrologist must look to hers. - That said, it seems
like bards might be the exception to this rule.
