Amber Pyro Mondstadt
Amber is an Outrider of the Knights of Favonius. In an age where Outriders are becoming obsolete,
she continues with her responsibilities. It takes a newcomer only a few days to feel right at home
with this passionate girl. Whether it's before the Good Hunter's signboard, the banks of Cider Lake,
or the treetops at Windrise, one can find traces of this vigilant Outrider in red anywhere. Once
spotted by her, no suspicious individual can ever escape her interrogation.
