Xiangling Pyro Liyue
"Coming, coming! Here's your Chicken Stir-Fry! And your Mora Meat. And Fried Radish Balls, as you
ordered."
In Liyue, there's a place called Chihu Rock, and there stands a restaurant known as Wanmin
Restaurant. Once must remain focused if they want to keep moving forward on the bustling streets
of Liyue. Unsuspecting newcomers to this place are often lured away by wonderful culinary aromas
or lead to peek inside stores by curious sounds.
Xiangling, who is both chef and waitress at the restaurant, delivers steaming delicious dishes to the
tables.
"Sit anywhere you'd like. I can make whatever you want, even if it's not on the menu!"
The workers at Wanmin Restaurant can recognize a regular, if not by their face, then by the first
sentence out of their mouths. A customer that orders without needing a menu have been at least a
few times before. However, if they ask "Is Xiangling the chef today?" then they're definitely a regular.
