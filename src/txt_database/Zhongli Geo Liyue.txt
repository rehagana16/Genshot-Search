Zhongli Geo Liyue
A mysterious guest invited by the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Extremely knowledgeable in all
things.
Zhongli does not bat an eyelid when paying (or when asking others to pay). He willingly pays the
asking price, no matter how unreasonable it is, and may pay even more for things he likes. The
funny thing is, Zhongli never remembers to take his purse with him.
