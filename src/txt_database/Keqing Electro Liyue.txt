Keqing Electro Liyue
One of the Liyue Qixing, Keqing has an uncompromising belief in actions over words. If she sees
something that needs doing, she'll do it herself. For example, she traveled around Liyue and
carefully memorized each detail of the land so that she may one day be able to maximize the
utility of every last inch of Liyue.
Keqing deals with the day-to-day affairs of Liyue, whether great or small, while Rex Lapis only
descends once a year. To many, the millennia of prosperity that Liyue has enjoyed serve to
legitimize Rex Lapis' guidance of the city. But Keqing has her reservations about all this, viewing
Liyue's present prosperity as akin to a magnificent sandcastle on the beach â€” humanity does
not have the luxury of deciding when the tide will come in.
Rex Lapis has watched over Liyue for a millennium. But what about the next millennium? What
about the next ten, or the next hundred millennia? How long are we expecting this status quo to
last?
It is this unanswered question that drives Keqing to work relentlessly and remain diligent. From
most people's perspective, there is no point in working oneself up like this. But Keqing cannot sit
by idly and ignore this hidden danger.
The people of Liyue have never considered navigating the future on their own terms. But
someone must walk on the front line of the epoch and forge a new path with their own hands.
