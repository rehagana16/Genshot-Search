Chongyun Cryo Liyue
Throughout its long history, Liyue has never had a lack of rumors and myths regarding all
manner of evil spirits and demons. And regardless of the truth of such rumors, someone has
to do something about them. Chongyun was born into a renowned family of exorcists and has
possessed a natural ability to drive away evil spirits from a young age due to his congenital
positivity. His powers of exorcism are far beyond the norm: his mere presence is sufficient to
scatter evil spirits. However, this has proven to be an inconvenience for Chongyun himself, for
though he has undertaken hundreds of successful exorcisms, he has never seen a single
ghost or demon. Chongyun believes that a true exorcist should exorcize evil with charms and
swordsmanship. This natural ability that he has...is just not orthodox. Therefore, he has
dedicated himself to the study of exorcism techniques and martial arts, as well as seeking the
haunts of evil spirits to prove himself an able and professional exorcist even without his
unique physical condition. Yet, when will that condition stop being a stumbling block on his
path to self-realization?
