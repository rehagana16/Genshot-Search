Fischl Electro Mondstadt
Fischl is the Prinzessin der Verurteilung who arrived here after being exiled from the otherworld,
"Immernachtreich." She "observes and weaves the threads of fate" together with her talking night
raven familiar, Oz. Owing to reasons she cannot and Oz will not explain, Fischl now serves the
Adventurers' Guild as an investigator.
