The few young adventurers that the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild has always found themselves tangled up in baffling bouts of bad luck. He is the only active member of his own adventure group, known as "Benny's Adventure Team," after all the other members decided to "take leave" following a series of unfortunate incidents.
