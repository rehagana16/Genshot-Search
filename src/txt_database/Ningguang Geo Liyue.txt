Ningguang Geo Liyue

The "Liyue Qixing" controls all of the commerce that takes place in Liyue Harbor. Its highly-
revered position is also coveted by many. Their primary ruling is to play things safe and keep a

low profile. The "Tianquan" of the Qixing, Ningguang, is the only exception. She is seen as an
excellent merchant in the eyes of her rivals, a friendly big-sister to kids, a socialite at the
banquets of Yujing Terrace, and a connoisseur of desserts... Ningguang is the talk of the town,
and all seem to know everything about her. However, they all seem to tell a different story of
Ningguang with great discrepancies between the versions. Still, if there's one thing all rumors
about her agree on, it's that Ningguang is someone truly extraordinary.
