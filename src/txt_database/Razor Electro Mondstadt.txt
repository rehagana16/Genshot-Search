Razor Electro Mondstadt
Razor is a boy whose identity is shrouded in mystery. He lives in Wolvendom and is rarely
spotted by the citizens of Mondstadt. According to the handful of eyewitness accounts, Razor
has keen senses and is highly agile, traversing the forest at breakneck speed. He is often seen in
the company of his wolf pack, while generally avoiding contact with humans. Some speculate
that he was an orphan raised by the wolves, while others say he is a wolf spirit that has taken on
a human form. Such rumors only add to the mystery of the "Wolf Boy," as the citizens of
Mondstadt call him. Meanwhile, Razor the Wolf Boy stands all the while on the hilltops with his
head held high, basking in the warm sunlight.
