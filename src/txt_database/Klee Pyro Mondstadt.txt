Klee Pyro Mondstadt
When asked about the strongest knight of the Knights of Favonius, three names are likely to come
up from the patrons in the taverns of Mondstadt: the highly-reputable Acting Grand Master Jean,
Cavalry Captain Kaeya, and the mysterious tycoon Diluc. However, some claim to have witnessed,
through drunken eyes or pale moonlight, a knight in red, leveling the entire Stormbearer Mountains.
If one wants to find this mysterious knight, then they need look no further than the solitary
confinement cell inside the Knights of Favonius Headquarters. If the cell is found vacant... then
something explosively unfortunate is likely about to take place... Klee is well known for the danger
she presents. As an official member of the Knights of Favonius, her strength in combat cannot be
underestimated. But as the hyperactive child that she also is, her destructive capabilities should not
be overlooked either. While other Mondstadt children her age are still playing with regular toys,
Klee's favorite toys are... live explosives.
