Sucrose Anemo Mondstadt
Sucrose may be the assistant of the genius alchemist Albedo, but they could not be more different in
research direction. As opposed to studying the essence of alchemy and the ability to create new life,
she is far more interested in using alchemy to modify existing life, all the better to add variety and
color to this world. Despite her youth, she has already achieved some brilliant results. For example,
she has been able to increase the nectar output of Sweet Flowers by 70% by irrigating them with a
special potion. She has also developed a special spray that allows Sunsettias to maintain their
freshness for a whole month after being plucked from the branch. Even people who were initially
suspicious of her research inclinations have come to acknowledge her exceptional talents in the field
of alchemy after seeing such results. However, she merely considers these to be incidental steps on
the path to a successful experiment, rather than the success itself. Her true aim is much more
ambitious than this. It's a secret, and is also her little dream.
